#Feet to Metres
An online tutorial I found making a simple Tkinter desktop Python app.
I will re-do the styles in colours I like.

This uses Python3.10.

There are two versions of the feet to metres app:

1) main.py is a basic, simple script without classes.
2) mainSelf.py is an example of using global variable and self and def __init__ structure. Just to show as an example.
